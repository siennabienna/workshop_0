#### In the first workshop, we were shown the basics of p5.js. The difference between setup and draw, and that draw always runs in a loop. We also learned simple shapes, such as rectangles (rect(x, y, w, h);), and circles (x, y, diameter);). I followed along with the workshop and had a play around on p5. 

##### Here, I am trying out the RGB of the background, and also have made a rectangle.

##### Here, I am trying more RGBs, as well as the stroke and fill.

#### I was really interested in the mouseX and mouseY functions, and trying to make something interactive. 
##### I made this, https://editor.p5js.org/siennabearbum/sketches/veVCeuil_ . One of the problems I encountered with this is that the circle wasn't touching the mouse when it followed. After going over the properties of circle on the p5 Reference page, I recalled that the third variable of circle is the diameter, and thus was only following the mouse by half of the mouses disance to the centre.

##### To fix this, I needed it to be equal to the radius, so I multiplied the variable in the code.

### I am very proud of my expanding circle!
