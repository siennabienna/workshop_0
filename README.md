# workshop_0

#### In the first workshop, we were shown the basics of p5.js. The difference between setup and draw, and that draw always runs in a loop. We also learned simple shapes, such as rectangles (rect(x, y, w, h);), and circles (x, y, radius);). I followed along with the workshop and had a play around on p5.
